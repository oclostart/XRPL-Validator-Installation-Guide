# HARDWARE - SPECS & CONFIGURATION

# HARDWARE SPECIFICATIONS
# Server Model: Dell R630
# Processor (CPU): 2 x  Xeon E5-2667V4 8-Core 3.2 GHz
# Memory (RAM): 64 GB (4 x 16GB) DDR4 2666 Mhz PC4 R Memory
# Network Card (NIC): FM487 1350 4 x 1-GBPS RJ-45
# Raid Controller: PERC H330 Mini Mono 12GB/s RAID Card
# Drive 1: 500 GB Samsung SSD SATA 6GB/s 2.5"
# Drive 2: 500 GB Samsung SSD SATA 6GB/s 2.5"
# Drive 3: 1 TB Samsung SSD SATA 6GB/s 2.5"
# Drive 4: 1 TB Samsung SSD SATA 6GB/s 2.5"

# RAID CONFIGURATION
# - Logical Drive 1: RAID 1 (Mirroring) with Drives 1 & 2 (500 GB SSDs)
# - Logical Drive 2: RAID 1 (Mirroring) with Drives 3 & 4 (1 TB SSDs)
# Note: RAID 1 requires identical drive models.

# RAID IMPLEMENTATION
# - RAID configuration steps are not included in this guideline.

# RAID ADVANTAGES
# - Redundancy: RAID 1 duplicates data across both drives, enabling an automatic failover if one drive fails.
# - Uptime: Supports hot-swapping (while actively running) of failed drives reducing downtime.

# RAID DISADVANTAGES
# - Cost: Requires additional drives.
# - Time: Requires configuration setup.

# DRIVE OPTIMIZATION
# - Logical Drive 1: Hosts the Operating System.
# - Logical Drive 2: Hosts the rippled database and log files.
# - Note: Can be implemented without a RAID configuration using two physical drives.

# DRIVE OPTIMIZATION ADVANTAGES
# - Reduces I/O contention.
# - Extends hardware lifespan.
# - Improves performance.

# DRIVE OPTIMIZATION DISADVANTAGES
# - Cost: Requires additional drives.
# - Time: Requires configuration setup.

# ADDITIONAL HARDWARE
# - Power Cable x 2
# - Cat 6 Network Cable
# - Monitor (Power & VGA cable)
# - USB Flash Drive (For OS installation)
# - USB Hub (In our case the VGA cable blocked the USB flash drive from inserting)
# - Keyboard
# - Mouse

# OPTIONAL INRASTRUCTURE
# - Server Rack
# - Server Rack Rails
# - PDU
# - UPS
# - AC Cooling System
# - 1 Gbps Internet Speed
